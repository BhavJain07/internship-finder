### USE OF THIS APP
This app is an open-source tool to analyze spreadsheets full of information regarding internships, summer programs, opportunities, and extracurriculars. 
Many newsletters send out huge weekly spreadsheets full of information, and at times it becomes too much to even look at, not letting you take any advantage of the opportunities. 
This tool lets you input .xlsx files (the default download of a google sheet) and uses set parameters and AI to sort the internships into the ones that you qualify for and ones that fit you best. The parameters in this model can be updated directly in the app.js file, and architecture is set up to use whatever LLM API keys you wish.
